/* Instructions: There is a single operator in JavaScript, capable of providing the remainder of a division operation. 
   Two numbers are passed as parameters. The first parameter divided by the second parameter will have a remainder, possibly zero. 
   Return that value. /* 


function remainder(x, y) {
	return (x%y);                  // % modulus (division remainder)
}

remainder(1, 3) ➞ 1
remainder(3, 4) ➞ 3
remainder(-9, 45) ➞ -9
remainder(5, 5) ➞ 0
